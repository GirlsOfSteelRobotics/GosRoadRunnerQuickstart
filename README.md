# Girls of Steel Road Runner Quickstart

This is basically a refactored fork of the [road runner quickstart](github.com/acmerobotics/road-runner-quickstart)

Check out the roadrunner [docs](https://rr.brott.dev/docs/v1-0/tuning/).

The point behind the refactoring was to facilitate easier reuse and make the code easier to read. This template can be used to quickly spin up a robot project with Road Runner support.
